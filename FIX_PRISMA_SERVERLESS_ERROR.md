# 🔧 Fix Prisma Serverless Error

## Problem
```
Error occurred during query execution:
ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: "42P05", message: "prepared statement \"s0\" already exists", severity: "ERROR", detail: None, column: None, hint: None }), transient: false })
```

## Root Cause
This error occurs in serverless environments (like Vercel) when Prisma tries to reuse prepared statements that already exist. This is a common issue with Prisma in serverless functions.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Prisma Client Configuration
- **Fixed global Prisma client management**
- **Added serverless optimizations**
- **Prevented multiple Prisma instances**
- **Used proper global variable handling**

### 2. Updated API Routes
- **Admin route now uses centralized Prisma client**
- **Consistent Prisma client usage across all routes**
- **Better error handling for serverless environments**

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Redeploy Backend
1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
2. **Find your backend project**
3. **Click "Redeploy"**
4. **Wait for deployment to complete**

### Step 2: Test Student Registration
1. **Go to your frontend**
2. **Login as chairman**
3. **Try registering a student**
4. **The Prisma error should be resolved!**

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
// Multiple Prisma client instances
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// Centralized Prisma client with serverless optimizations
import { prisma } from '../../../lib/prisma'
```

## 🎯 Expected Results
After redeployment:
- ✅ No more "prepared statement already exists" errors
- ✅ Student registration works
- ✅ Coordinator registration works
- ✅ All database operations work properly

## 🚀 Quick Action
1. **Redeploy your backend**
2. **Test student registration**
3. **Test coordinator registration**

The Prisma serverless error should now be completely resolved! 🎯
